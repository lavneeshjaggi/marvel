                <p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and shared universe 
                centered on a series of superhero films, independently produced by Marvel Studios and based 
                on characters that appear in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The 
                franchise also includes comic books, short films, television series, and digital series. 
                The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was established 
                by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. Phil Coulson, 
                portrayed by Clark Gregg, is an original character to the MCU and the only character to 
                appear across all its different media.<br>

                <br>The first MCU film was Iron Man (2008), which began the first phase of films culminating in 
                the crossover film The Avengers (2012). Phase Two began with Iron Man 3 (2013) and 
                concluded with Ant-Man (2015). Phase Three began with Captain America: Civil War (2016) 
                and is set to conclude with Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). The first three phases in the 
                franchise are collectively known as "The Infinity Saga". Marvel Television expanded the 
                universe to network television with Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC in the 2013â€“14 
                television season, followed by online streaming with Marvel's Daredevil on Netflix in 2015 
                and Marvel's Runaways on Hulu in 2017, and then to cable television with Marvel's Cloak & 
                Dagger on Freeform in 2018. Marvel Television also produced the digital series Marvel's 
                Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot. Soundtrack albums have been released for all the films 
                and many of the television series, as well compilation albums containing existing music 
                heard in the films. The MCU also includes tie-in comics published by Marvel Comics, while 
                Marvel Studios has also produced a series of direct-to-video short films and a viral 
                marketing campaign for its films and the universe with the faux news program WHIH Newsfront.
                <br>

                <br>The franchise has been commercially successful, though some critics have found that some of 
                its films and television series have suffered in service of the wider universe. It has 
                inspired other film and television studios with comic book character adaptation rights to 
                attempt to create similar shared universes. The MCU has also been the focus of other media, 
                outside of the shared universe, including attractions at various Walt Disney Parks and 
                Resorts, an attraction at Discovery Times Square, a Queensland Gallery of Modern Art 
                exhibit, two television specials, guidebooks for each film, multiple tie-in video games, 
                and commercials.<br>

            <p><br>By 2005, Marvel Entertainment began planning to independently produce its own films and 
            distribute them through Paramount Pictures. Previously, Marvel had co-produced several 
            superhero films with Columbia Pictures, New Line Cinema and others, including a seven-year 
            development deal with 20th Century Fox. Marvel made relatively little profit from its 
            licensing deals with other studios and wanted to get more money out of its films while 
            maintaining artistic control of the projects and distribution. Avi Arad, head of Marvel's 
            film division, was pleased with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films at Sony, but was less pleased 
            about others. As a result, they decided to form Marvel Studios, Hollywood's first major 
            independent movie studio since DreamWorks.<br>

            <br>Arad's second-in-command, Kevin Feige, realized that unlike Spider-Man and the X-Men, whose 
            film rights were licensed to Sony and Fox, respectively, Marvel still owned the rights to the 
            core members of the Avengers. Feige, a self-professed "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared 
            universe just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the early 
            1960s. To raise capital, the studio secured funding from a seven-year, $525 million 
            revolving credit facility with Merrill Lynch. Marvel's plan was to release individual 
            films for their main characters and then merge them in a crossover film. Arad, who doubted 
            the strategy yet insisted that it was his reputation that helped secure the initial financing, 
            resigned the following year.
